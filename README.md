clash-server
============

Server for the 2014-2015 MPS project

C++ Development
============
For those of you writing in C++, you can extend the class Communication, from Client.

Other Languages
============
For those of you writing in other languages, you can either make a wrapper to the Communication class and talk through files, stdin/stdout, sockets, ethernet.
However, to simplify the development, we will offer a set of commands that the server will be sending or you will send to the server, probably through something simple like stdin/stdout.
